# RS-485 Keyboard PCB
The PCB is equipped with an Arduino Nano and 24 keyboard switches and communicates via RS-485.
The keys are arranged in a 8x3 matrix. It's also possible to connect a rotary encoder and potentiometer. The keyboard is meant to control leds: press R and scroll the rotary encoder to alter the red value or H to alter hue, but I didn't code that yet.
